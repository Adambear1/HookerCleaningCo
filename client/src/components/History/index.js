            Hooker company started humbly with just a husband and wife in 1981.
            The Hookers started out by cleaning residential homes in Seattle.
            This soon spread to servicing commercial buildings and office spaces
            all over the region. â€‹ Today, Hooker Company continues to grow while
            keeping the heart and soul of the family company alive and well. We
            strive to build a company who truly cares about their clients and
            employees. We are the masters of cleaning and will always strive to
            do more, learn more, and give more!
