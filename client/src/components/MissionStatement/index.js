          <p class="card-text">
            Our mission is to protect your asset through our strong team of
            dedicated employees in continually building a culture of excellent

          <h5 class="card-title">It Is Our Vision...</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            To be the premier janitorial company on the west coast. Not by being
            better at cleaning because everyone knows how to clean, but by being
            the best in the industry at customer service, knowing that when
            another company hires us for their janitorial needs, they know that
            they will receive not only a great clean but even better customer
            service.
          </p>
          <h5 class="card-title">The Company's Philosophy...</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            is based on a set of ethos that ultimately guides the leadership,
            management, and employees in order to fulfill our companies mission
            and vision statement with relentless excellence. Those ethos are
            outlined as followed:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Empathy: </b>clients need to feel and hear that we care
                first. More than words, a caring tone of voice allows the client
                to hear your concern. One of the best client interactions
                happens when a client feels that he/she has been listened to and
                understood. No matter how large or small, empathy is an
                essential service mentality.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Enthusiasm: </b> the level of enthusiasm people exhibit is a
                critical component to how the world perceives them as being able
                or willing to help. Enthusiasm influences a person’s
                effectiveness in a service position. People who are truly
                enthusiastic don’t discriminate between their activities, no
                matter the duty always exemplifying great enthusiasm.
                Enthusiastic people enjoy being proactive and going the extra
                mile to help team members and clients without being asked.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Ownership: </b> it should not take two people to provide good
                customer service. Ownership is partnering with the client to
                address their need to solve the problem. When we “own” the
                problem we are more committed to the resolution of the problem.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Responsibility: </b> responsibility is an important internal
                customer service issue. It is as important to be considerate and
                responsible to our co-workers as it is to our clients.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Adaptability: </b> adaptive people can handle all types of
                clients and situations positively. Adaptability is changing your
                approach to each type of client. Service each client
                respectfully and effectively.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Resiliency: </b> remain calm throughout adverse situations,
                recover quickly and don’t show signs of discouragement.
                Resiliency is seen when great employees speak with controlled
                pace and vocabulary. Life’s setbacks and disappointments need to
                be handles by bouncing back emotionally and professionally.
                Never take it out on the next few innocent clients or employees.
